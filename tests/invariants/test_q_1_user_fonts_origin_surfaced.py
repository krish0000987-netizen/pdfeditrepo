"""INV-Q-1 (F-D-CC9): user-fonts origin must surface as Degradation.

Closed in v0.1.3 commit 06: ``system_fonts._build_font_cache`` canonicalises
every cached path via ``os.path.realpath`` (catching POSIX symlinks AND
Windows directory junctions, mirroring ``_pathutil.validate_output_path``)
and refuses entries whose real path escapes ``_font_directories()``.
``_find_font_with_origin`` returns ``(path, origin, substituted_name)``
where ``origin`` is one of ``"system"``, ``"user"``,
``"metric_equivalent"``. Tier 1.5 (``_extend_simple_tier_one_five`` /
``_extend_tier2``) emits
``Degradation(kind="font_substituted_from_user_fonts", severity="warning")``
into the caller-supplied ``degradations`` list whenever ``origin == "user"``.

The Degradation is NOT in ``FONT_AFFECTING_KINDS``: the font WAS found
and used. The kind exists to surface the security-relevant origin so
callers can detect when an injected glyph outline came from a path an
unprivileged process could have primed (F-D-CC9 Medium severity).

Two probes:

1. **Resolver probe** (Windows-only, plants a real font under
   ``~/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Fonts/PlantedTest_INV_Q_1.ttf``;
   cleanup runs in finally:): asserts ``_find_font_with_origin`` returns
   ``origin == "user"`` for the planted name. The planted file's
   PostScript name is unique to avoid collision with any host font.

2. **Extension probe** (cross-platform; monkeypatches
   ``_find_font_with_origin`` to return ``origin="user"``): asserts
   ``_extend_simple_tier_one_five`` appends
   ``Degradation(kind="font_substituted_from_user_fonts")`` to the
   caller-supplied ``degradations`` list. Uses the same simple-font
   fixture as ``test_simple_extension.py``.
